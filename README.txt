Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Course Assigment.
Based on the original following dataset:

	==================================================================
	Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
	Version 1.0
	==================================================================
	Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
	Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
	DITEN - Università degli Studi di Genova.
	Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.

	==================================================================

	The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

	The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'run_analysis.r': Script that utilizes the existing data set and creates the following test files:
	- 'full_data.txt': Full data as described above.
	- 'tidy_data.txt': Average measurements grouped by Subject and Activity.

NOTE: This script assumes access to the existing data set.  Extract the zipped data set into your working directory. (EX: <working directory> '/UCI HAR Dataset'
